# Movie Wishlist Android App Assignment

Consider the situation of someone who wants to create and manage a wishlist of movies they want to watch. Develop a simple, attractive, and intuitive Android mobile app to assist users in organizing their movie-watching preferences. Letâ€™s name this app: `YOURCCID-MyMovieWishlist` (e.g., `kennyw-MyMovieWishlist`).

## Functional Requirements

Using this app, users can maintain a list of movies they wish to watch. Each movie entry in the wishlist has the following editable fields:

- **Movie title** (textual, up to 50 characters)  
- **Director name** (textual, up to 30 characters)  
- **Genre** (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy)  
- **Release year** (four-digit integer)  
- **Status** (Watched/Unwatched)  

The app must allow the user to:

- Show a list of movies in their wishlist, displaying the title, director, genre, and watch status.
- Add a new movie to the wishlist (appends to the bottom of the list).
- View and edit the details of an existing movie entry, including title, director, genre, and watch status.
- Delete a movie from the wishlist.
- See the total number of movies in the wishlist and the count of movies marked as watched.

The list need not display all the information for an item if screen space is limited. Minimally, each item in the list should show its title, director, genre, and watch status.

## Usability Requirements

The app must assist the user in proper data entry. For example, use appropriate user interface controls to enforce particular data types and avoid illegal values.

## Data Persistence

For this assignment, the data need not be persistent across runs of the app.

## Naming Requirements

Encode your campus computing ID in the app name. Specifically, the app name must show up as `YOURCCID-MyMovieWishlist` (e.g., `kennyw-MyMovieWishlist`).
